- `in`: indicates what subsystem or module of a codebase the issue is located in, e.g. `in:UI`, `in:network`, `in:arbitration`
- `on`: indicates which specific operating systems an issue applies to, e.g. `on:macOS`, `on:Linux`, `on:Windows`
- `re`: indicates which cross-cutting concerns and external dependencies an issue regards, e.g. `re:privacy`, `re: testing`, `re:Tor`, `re:Bitcoin`
- `was`: indicates why an issue was closed, if it was closed for any other reason than being complete/fixed, e.g. `was:duplicate`, `was:moved`, `was:superseded`
